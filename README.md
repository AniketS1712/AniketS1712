## 👋 About Me

I’m a **mobile-first developer** focused on building applications that feel intuitive, responsive, and intentional.

- 📱 Primary focus: **Flutter** for cross-platform apps  
- 🎨 Strong interest in **UI-heavy, interactive, and game-like experiences**  
- 🧠 I enjoy experimenting with animations, layouts, and user flows  
- 🧩 I care about **how users interact**, not just how features work  

I try to think like both a **developer and a designer**, so the final product makes sense technically *and* emotionally.

## 🚧 Currently Building

- 📦 **Stock Register App (Flutter)**  
  A real-world **CRUD-based application** for factory owners to:
  - Manage stock entries
  - Track incoming/outgoing materials
  - Maintain clean, reliable records  
  Built with a focus on **data consistency, usability, and simple workflows**

- 🎮 Exploring **experimental Flutter projects**  
  UI-driven apps and small games to push interaction design and animation skills
